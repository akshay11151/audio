This Python script uses the SpeechRecognition library to transcribe audio files into text, categorize the text based on keywords, and upload files to a cloud storage service if the category indicates that the file contains important information. The script records audio in WAV format, and transcribes the text using Google's speech recognition service. The categorized text is used to determine whether the file should be uploaded to the cloud storage service. This script can be used for a variety of purposes, such as recording and categorizing notes, recording and categorizing customer feedback, and more.
